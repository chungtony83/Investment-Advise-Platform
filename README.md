# Investment Analysis Platform Documentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an investment analysis platform focusing on the US stock market. The platform will fetch real-time market data, analyze stock trends, visualize current portfolio positions, and provide actionable investment insights.

## Objectives

* Automate data retrieval from market sources.
* Store and manage market data and portfolio information.
* Conduct analytical processes on stocks and portfolio performance.
* Present intuitive visualizations via a user-friendly website interface.
* Generate practical investment suggestions based on analyzed data.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

* **Source:** Schwab Trader API
* **Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow (Three-legged OAuth) to securely interact with Schwab APIs.
* **Data Types:** Real-time stock prices, historical data, and current positions.
* **Frequency:** Scheduled data fetch using automated scripts.

### 2. Data Storage

* Utilize SQLite or PostgreSQL to manage structured financial data.
* Schema design for efficient storage and retrieval of market and portfolio data.

### 3. Data Analysis

* Calculate essential financial metrics (e.g., moving averages, returns, volatility).
* Conduct trend analysis and identify key investment signals.
* Evaluate portfolio performance (e.g., total returns, diversification).

### 4. Data Visualization

* Develop interactive charts and dashboards using Python libraries such as Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit.
* Ensure visualizations are intuitive, providing clear insights into market trends and portfolio health.

### 5. Investment Suggestions

* Build simple decision-making models based on predefined investment strategies (e.g., moving average crossovers, volatility thresholds).
* Provide clear, actionable recommendations derived from analytical results.

## Technical Specifications

* **Backend:** Python, SQL
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React or Streamlit for rapid prototyping.
* **API Integration:** Schwab Trader API, OAuth 2.0 authorization.

## Security

* Secure handling of OAuth tokens with proper token lifecycle management (Access Tokens valid for 30 minutes, Refresh Tokens valid for 7 days).
* Implement HTTPS for all web traffic and sensitive data exchanges.

## Project Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Environment:** Git repository, Python environment, and database configuration.
2. **API Authentication:** Establish OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with Schwab API.
3. **Data Acquisition:** Develop automated scripts for periodic data fetching.
4. **Database Management:** Create schemas and mechanisms for reliable data storage.
5. **Data Processing and Analysis:** Implement analytical logic for deriving insights.
6. **Visualization Development:** Develop frontend to visualize insights clearly.
7. **Recommendation Engine:** Build logic to automate investment recommendations based on analysis.
8. **Testing and Deployment:** Thorough testing and deployment on local or cloud-based environments.

## Version Control

* GitHub for version control, collaboration, and issue tracking.

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate more advanced machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics.
* Enhance the robustness of the platform with improved scalability and security.
